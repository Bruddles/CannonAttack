The CannonAttack Requirements/Specs:

The following is a combination of Requirements and Specifications that will give us some guide in terms of the application we are trying to build:
Windows Console Application;
Player identified by an id, default is set to a constant "Human";
Single player only, no multi-play yet;
Allow player to set Angle and Speed of the Cannon Ball to Shoot at a Target;
Target Distance is simply the distance of the Cannon to Target, and is created randomly by default but can be overridden;
Angle and Speed needs to be validated (specifically not greater than 90 degrees and Speed not greater than speed of light);
Max distance for target is 20000 meters;
Base the algorithm for the calculation of the cannons trajectory upon the following C# code (distance and height is meters and velocity is meters per second):
distance = velocity * Math.Cos(angleInRadians) * time;
height = (velocity * Math.Sin(angleInRadians) * time) - (GRAVITY * Math.Pow(time, 2)) / 2;
A hit occurs if the cannon is within 50m of the target;
Display number of shots for a hit
Game text will be similar to following: 
Welcome to Cannon Attack
Target Distance:12621m

Missed cannonball landed at 12333m
